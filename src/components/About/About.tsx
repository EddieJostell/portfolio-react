                  Hello! My name is Eddie and I enjoy creating things on the
                  world wide web. I started my journey in web-development around
                  2014 by studying .NET development. When Im not hitting the
                  keyboard to create magic on the web or playing games I like to
                  hang out with my friends, go to the gym, long walks, relax
                  with movies/tvshows or just listening to good music.
                </div>
                <br />
                <div>
                  Before I became a web-developer I played at a
                  semi-professional level in the computer game Counter Strike -
                  Global Offensive. Playing this game has helped me with my
                  logical thinking and to work as part of a team, Even tho I
                  dont play on that level anymore I still play for fun with my
                  friends.
